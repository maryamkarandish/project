## File Nameing

In this repo we are fixing the file naming for different type of files we had in the repo. 
The file naming should have the following structure:

1. Be easy to read and informative to a human
2. Be machine-readable
3. Play well with default ordering

------------------------------------

## Project Organization

In the second part of the project we create appropriate folders to place each file in it and organize the files in the repo
for example put all python file in the src folder. The reason to do that includes:

* Well-organized code is self documenting
* A new collaborator would immediately know where to look for specific things
* Your future self would find it much easier to reproduce your own results

------------------------------------

## Conda

In the second part of the project we provide environment.yaml file with all the libraries needed for the report to use.
This file make it easier to provide the necessary enviroment to run the files in this repo with necessary environment and version compability
